# credit_risk_classification

The purpose of the analysis on is to predict whether a loan is high-risk or low-risk. Accuracy, precision, and recall are all evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the machine learning model. Here are the scores achieved by the model in the analysis:
Accuracy: 0.99
Precision: 0.84
Recall: 0.91

The results show that the model performs well with an accuracy score of 0.99. The precision score of 0.84 means that the model has a good ability to predict high-risk loans, while the recall score of 0.91 indicates that the model is able to minimize the number of false negatives. 

Based on the results, I would recommend using the model for credit risk assessment. The high accuracy and precision scores show that the model is effective in identifying high-risk loans, which is crucial for minimizing the potential financial losses for the company.
